This is a repository for the construction of a NEO in Japan

The geometry folder contains files to simplify Japan's geometry for better computer representation. The sub-folder utils contains functions
used to create the geometric representation while the geometries sub-folders contain the actual geometries. Within the geometries sub-folder, finer_grain.json and rougher_grain.json contain the actual representations of Japan.

The population folder contains files to populate the discretized geometry with a population density function. This includes
necessary data manipulation and visualization tools. 

The routing folder contains logic to route vehicles.
